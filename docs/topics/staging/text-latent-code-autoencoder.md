# Text-latent code autoencoder — frozen LLMs as encoder/decoder, prompts as the only learned object

**Kind:** staging. Candidate exits: a standalone project doc (representation learning /
program synthesis; program pillars served: none), or a parked idea. Gate: pin down the bottleneck constraint on the latent (see
"The open question" below) before any promotion decision.

Source: an external conversation excerpt, 2026-08-22. Danielle's original prompt was not
pasted; the setup below is the respondent's playback of it. Related-work claims in the quoted
material (round-trip correctness, DSPy, OPRO, TextGrad, LLMLingua, gist tokens) are
**unverified** — treat as leads, not facts.

## 2026-08-22 — the idea as played back

> You want representation-space benefits (latent dynamics, style manipulation) without weight
> updates, so you'd build an autoencoder where encoder and decoder are both frozen frontier
> LLMs behind APIs, the latent is *text* (hence natively consumable by any LLM), and the only
> learnable object is the harness — the prompts — optimized by an LLM outer loop against
> round-trip reconstruction, scored by test pass rate.

## The assessment (near-verbatim)

**Bottleneck.** "Without some constraint on the latent representation — length budget, schema
restrictions, forbidding code tokens — the degenerate solution is just the code itself, which
doesn't buy you structure. The interesting problem is really about what constraint makes the
latent meaningful and useful. This feels like a rate-distortion question." "The LLM optimizer
will try to cheat by smuggling the source through any opening I leave, so the constraints have
to be verifiable, not just suggested in the prompt."

**What is actually being built.** "You're not creating embeddings in the vector sense; you're
designing a discrete, human-readable intermediate representation. That's actually a strength
for some of your goals — style transfer, editing, interpretability all work better when the
latent is editable and legible — but it breaks others like interpolation or nearest-neighbor
search that rely on geometric structure." Connects to literate programming and pseudo-code
as IR; encoder extracts specs, decoder synthesizes programs.

**Objective tension.** "The test-pass objective is elegant but it only preserves function;
style is exactly what it's free to throw away" — variable names, idioms, structure are the
first things an optimizer under a length budget discards. Fixes: a style-preservation loss
term, or a factored latent (functional spec field + style field, each with its own
objective), which would also enable style transfer by swapping fields. "That's probably the
biggest gap between the current setup and your stated goals."

**Forward model in latent space.** "An LLM predicting the next latent from the current one,
but the real case for this hinges on whether compression and abstraction make prediction
cheaper than just prompting on raw code."

**Strengths.** Training-free; works with closed models; the round-trip + tests signal is
clean, self-supervised, and scalable; human-readable latents give interpretability and
editability — "you can actually intervene in latent space using natural language."

**Practical costs.** Each optimization step encodes, decodes, and tests across batches, and
LLM-based optimizers compound this; API nondeterminism, temperature sensitivity, and model
version drift; the latent space is implicitly defined by the (model, prompt) pair, so
switching models changes it entirely; comparability across samples depends on format
constraints; the optimizer can overfit prompts to the dev set; test-pass evaluation is
noisy and expensive and prompt optimization plateaus — budget for variance.

**Prior work named (unverified).** Round-trip correctness as an eval metric (attributed to
DeepMind, ICML 2024); LLM-as-optimizer frameworks (DSPy, OPRO, TextGrad); prompt compression
(LLMLingua); gist tokens (skipped as it involves training). Claimed novelty: "treating the
optimized intermediate representation itself as a learned latent space."

## The open question

What form does the bottleneck take — token budget, fixed schema, syntax restriction — and is
it verifiable? Everything downstream (whether geometric structure is needed at all, whether
this is more than a compression trick, whether style survives) depends on it. Secondary:
single monolithic latent vs. factored schema; how the style and function objectives are
balanced.

**Waiting on:** Danielle's answer on the bottleneck; a promotion decision.
