# Data Quality Assessment - 2025-09-13

## Critical Data Quality Findings

### Data Completeness Issues
- **Model size completeness**: Only 83.3% complete - major schema validation needed
- **Learning rate completeness**: 99.4% complete - mostly reliable
- **Training loss completeness**: 94.1% complete - good coverage
- **Evaluation data coverage**: 87.4% of runs have evaluation data

### Model Size Discrepancies
- **Metadata vs name parsing**: Complex model size mapping (11 distinct parameter counts vs 4 name categories)
- **Parameter counts**: Range from 3.7M to 681.3M (not the clean 4M/10M/60M/150M from names)
- **Schema challenge**: Need mapping between name-based sizes and actual parameter counts

### Learning Rate Complexity
- **80 unique learning rates** vs expected systematic sweep
- **Wide range**: 3.53e-11 to 5.00e-04 (much broader than name-based analysis)
- **Schema implication**: Name-based LR extraction insufficient for complete data access

### Training Progress Data Quality
- **History coverage**: 321/341 runs (94.1%) have training progression data
- **20,191 total training records** - very rich temporal data available
- **Variable training lengths**: 100 to 14,600 steps (mean: 3,509, median: 1,000)

### Evaluation Metrics Landscape
- **418 total evaluation metrics available**
- **Key categories**: OLMES Suite (38), Reasoning Tasks (259), Perplexity (11)
- **Sample coverage**: pretrain_eval_mmlu_acc_raw available for 225 runs
- **Integration challenge**: Need mapping between pretrain and posttraining eval formats

### Run Completion Status
- **Successful completion**: 255/341 (74.8%) finished successfully
- **Active/failed runs**: 86 runs not finished (running: 54, crashed: 25, failed: 7)
- **Schema validation**: Need to filter for completed runs in analysis

## Design Implications for SupervisedFinetuningData

1. **Robust missing value handling** required (16.7% missing model sizes)
2. **Complex parameter mapping** needed between names and actual values
3. **Run status filtering** essential (only use finished runs for analysis)
4. **Rich temporal data available** for training progression analysis
5. **Comprehensive evaluation mapping** needed across pretrain/posttraining formats
